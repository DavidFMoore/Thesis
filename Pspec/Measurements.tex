\chapter{Power Spectra} \label{chap:PowerSpectra}

To directly measure the level of polarized power described and simulated in the previous two
sections, we turn to data taken during the EoR2011 observing campaign defined in Table
\ref{tab:deploy}. While the primary objective of this campaign was to measure the mostly unpolarized
signature of neutral Hydrogen in the early universe \cite{Parsons2014, Jacobs2014}, it could not
reach the sensitivity levels required to characterize or even detect the power spectrum. Hence, it
is a useful study for characterizing foregrounds. All four polarization products were correlated specifically to
characterize the level of polarized power which could corrupt 21cm EoR power spectrum measurements.

  (Top Panel) Antenna positions, referenced to the top, left antenna. (Bottom Panel) $uv$-coverage
  for the entire array in black. The $uv$-coverage of the subset of antennae used for this analysis 
  is shown in cyan. To give a sense of scale between the $u$- and $v$-axes, concentric circles with
  radii of $2\lambda$, $5\lambda$, $10\lambda$, $20\lambda$, $50\lambda$, and $100\lambda$ are shown.
  Since the power spectrum is computed for each integration, there is no Earth-rotation synthesis.
}{Antenna positions and $uv$-coverage}
As as brief reminder of Section \ref{sec:deploy} and Table \ref{tab:deploy}, this data was
taken during Winter of 2011 and Spring of 2012, spanning eighty-two nights of observations.
PAPER's configuration for this season was in an $8\times4$ grid. Since the antennae are
arranged in a redundant grid, we can label the subsets of redundant baselines by their grid
spacings. For instance, a baseline composed of two adjacent antennae in the same row can be written
$(0,1)$. Similarly, a baseline composed of two adjacent antennae in the same column can be written
as $(1,0)$. For the results presented here, and in the two sister papers to this work,
\cite{Jacobs2014, Parsons2014}, only baseline types $(0,1)$, $(1,1)$, and $(-1,1)$ are considered. 
The row-spacings in this configuration were 30m, chosen to reduce the extent of the foreground wedge 
without incurring the any antenna-to-antenna cross talk. The column spacings were 4m, maximizing 
the redundancy between baselines $(0,1)$ and $(1,1)$ or $(-1,1)$. Figure \ref{fig:uv_coverage} shows
a map of the antenna spacing, as well as the $uv$-coverage of the array. The four-degree offset of
the columns from true north is due to the projection of the tangent plane to the Earth at the
array location to UTM plane 34.

Data was taken continuously from 6pm SAST until 6am SAST each night during this campaign. To remove
effects of the sun, we only consider data when the sun is below -5$^\circ$ in altitude. We restrict
the number of nights due to some systematic errors which corrupt the data after April 1, 2012
--- Julian Date 2456018. A catastrophic event occurred on this date,\footnote{Because I observed
this data remotely, I can only guess, but my money is on a lightning strike.} and most of the data
taken after it was unusable. 82 nights of data survived quality checks and are used for this
analysis. 

\figuremacroW{FOV.eps}{1.0}{fig:fov}{
  Effective integration time per pointing (Equation \ref{eq:teff}), as a function of position on the sphere.
}{Effective integration time for each pointing on the sphere}
We focus our efforts on the range in LST from 1h00m until 8h00m, which maximizes the total
integration time available, but minimizes the effects of systematics. Since PAPER is a drift-scan
array, this sets both the pointing and the field of view. Figure \ref{fig:fov} shows a map of effective 
integration time per pointing, defined as 
\begin{equation}
  t_{eff}(\alpha,\delta) = \sum_{i} t_{int} A(\alpha,\delta,t_i)
  \label{eq:teff}
\end{equation}
where the sum extends over the each integration in the season. This metric is defined to give the total 
integration time when integrated over position on the sphere. The total field of view surveyed is 2.39 sr. 

Finally, we restrict the final analysis to two bands, though the full range of frequencies is used 
throughout much of the analysis. We label the lower one Band I, and the upper, Band II. Band II 
corresponds with that used for the results in \citet{Parsons2014}, and Band I is chosen to correspond 
to the lowest band in \citet{Jacobs2014}. Many of the observational parameters defining these two bands 
are presented in Table \ref{tab:obsparams}.

This Chapter outlines the processing and analysis of the polarization properties of this
data. Section \ref{sec:data} describes the analysis and quality checks this data underwent; Section
\ref{sec:results} presents the power spectra of these data, and finally, Section \ref{sec:updates}
gives the physical properties of polarized point sources that these data imply.
