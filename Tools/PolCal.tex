\chapter{New Methods for Polarization Calibration}\label{chap:PolCal}

This chapter presents two novel approaches to polarization calibration, designed mainly for
redundant, widefield arrays like PAPER. The two authoritative sources in interferometric
polarization calibration are the series of papers by Hamacker, Bregman, and Sault \cite{HBS1,HBS2,HBS3,HBS4,HBS5} and
Chapter three of \citet{TMS}. They present a calibration scheme in which instrumental
polarization is represented in terms of a rotation matrix $\B{D}_i$, comprised of off-diagonal
terms of the gain equation presented in Section \ref{sec:Polarimetry}, in Equation
\ref{eq:def_gains}. In the Jones formalism, the measured electric field can be described by
the equation 
\begin{equation}
  \begin{pmatrix}E_x\\E_y\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}g_{ix} & 0 \\ 0 &  g_{iy}\end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}1&d_{iy}\\-d_{ix}&1\end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}\cos\psi & -\sin\psi \\ \sin\psi & \cos\psi\end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}E_\alpha\\E_\delta\end{pmatrix}
\equiv
  \B{G}_i\cdot\B{D}_i\cdot\B{P}\cdot\vec{E},
  \label{eq:def_D}
\end{equation}
where all terms agree with Equation \ref{eq:def_gains}. The new, off-diagonal terms $d_{ix}$, e.g.
may be written in term of the three Euler angles of the feed of an antenna \cite{TMS}, but in
general, instrumental polarization arises in the analog electronics, and cannot be represented so
simply.

The cited sources give prescriptions for solving for the $4N_{ant}$ complex calibration terms as
functions of both time and frequency, but these methods require two criteria which PAPER does not meet:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The primary beam must be dominated by a single or few calibration sources. With PAPER's
    nearly 1 sr beam, there will almost certainly be a plethora of sources with calibration-level
    sensitivities.
  \item The $uv$-coverage of the array must be filled to sufficiently isolate point sources,
    creating a clarity of image which PAPER in its redundant configuration cannot provide.
\end{enumerate}

With these two criteria in mind, we must find non-traditional calibration methods. We present two:
the first of which relies on the redundancy of identical baselines, and the second synthesizes images of
only a few pointings on the sphere.
