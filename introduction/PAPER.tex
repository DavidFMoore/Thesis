The Donald C. Backer Precision Array to Probe the Epoch of Reionization
(PAPER)\nomenclature[Zp]{PAPER}{The Donald C. Backer Precision Array to Probe the Epoch of
Reionization} was built specifically to detect the 21cm EoR power spectrum in mind. To
achieve this goal, many design choices violate the assumptions made in normal interferometric
analysis --- the two most pertinent of these are the flat sky approximation, and the assumption
that one source dominates the field of view. This chapter will describe the instrument and discuss
the impetus for many characteristics of the array. Much of this material is discussed in
\citet{PGB8}, but several improvements have been made since 2009, when that paper was
written.
